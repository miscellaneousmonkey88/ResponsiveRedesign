      Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems
    </div>

    <div id="txt">
    I chose to redesign the website for Heng Thai. While browsing websites for nearby restaurants, I noticed
    that this one was especially confusing and unpolished. When you first go to the webpage, you can click on
    one of the two locations to be redirected to the menu & ordering for that location. The text at the top,
    however, states that "there are three links for each location", which is confusing.
      <br><br>
      As we continue to scroll down, there is a random advertisement for Heng's oyster sauce (with no link to buy
      it), and a series of vertically arranged youtube cooking videos which make use of this sauce. To actually order
      the product, I would have to navigate to one of the sites and then find the sauce under the "product" tab in 
      the navigation bar. This is confusing to sometone using the website and is also a poor marketing scheme.
      <br><br>
      Among the errors noted by WebAIM Wave are very low contrast, very small text, and lack of alternative text.
      I agree that the visual color contrast is not very good, and there's nowhere that the eye naturally jumps to.
      That can also partially be attributed to small text and lack of headers, which was also noted by WebAIM Wave.
      The website is overall very confusing and ineffective at marketing or enticing customers.
